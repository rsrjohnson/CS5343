assignment-4
Make an undirected, but disconnected graph of at least 15 vertices and 25 edges.

you may add function calls in your main to add edges between vertices - one function call per edge.  You may choose any graph representation of your choice from the 3 ways we discussed in the class.

Write a program to do DFS traversal of the graph.

Also write a program to do BFS traversal of the same graph.

Draw your graph on a paper and upload it with you code.

run the each of the two programs and capture screen shots and submit them.  Check that the program does indeed do the correct traversal (based on your hand drawn graph)
