We have discussed Binary Search Trees.(BST)

Write a program to implement a delete operation from BST.

You will have to write the program to insert nodes in the BST also (we already did the algorithm in detail in the class for insert).

Insert the following nodes in the order mentioned here.

40, 60, 20, 80, 50, 10, 30, 15, 5, 35, 25, 45, 55, 70, 90, 32, 33, 48, 46

Do an inorder traversal.

Now delete 40 (you decide predecessor or successor).

Do inorder traversal again.

Make screen shot

Now delete 20

Do inroder traversal

Submit the code.

Submit the screen shots.
